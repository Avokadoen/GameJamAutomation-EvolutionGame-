# GameJamAutomation
## What is it
This projects was an attempt at simulating evolution. The scene consist of predators (carnivores) and other plant eating animals attempting to survive using State-Machines for behaviours. As this was a jam there is a lot of features we would like to implement that we did not have time to as mating, childs inheriting stats from parents and general improvements on the scene and behaviour.
